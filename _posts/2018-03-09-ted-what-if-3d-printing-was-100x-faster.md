  Joseph DeSimone explains why 3D printing is in fact just 2D printing repeatedly over time. He explains how the scene in the Terminator 2 movie, where the T1000 arise out of a puddle in real time, raise the question why can't we perform 3D printing like this. An object arise out of a puddle in real time without any waste, was set as the challenge.
