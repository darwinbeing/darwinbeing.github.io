excerpt:
  Homebrew is a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on Apple's macOS operating system. It is known as the missing package manager for macOS. Homebrew is written in the Ruby programming language and targets the version of Ruby that comes installed with the macOS operating system. Homebrew installs packages to their own directory (Cellar) and then symlinks their files into /usr/local.
